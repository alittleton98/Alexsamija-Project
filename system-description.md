# System Description and Software Engineering

There are 3 devices that take part in this experiment. 

1. Student: "Rosalind Lutece". Excels at numerical concepts and operations. Struggles with complex words
2. Student: "Robert Lutece" Excels at language, but struggles with complex numerical operations
3. Teacher: "GLaDOS \(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System\)"

Systems are given pronouns within the documentation based on the character names. Robert is "he/him/his". Rosalind and GLaDOS are "she/her/hers"
